2015 FRC Robot for game even Recycle Rush

This is just the code for our robot that is still un-named as we are only two weeks into the build season for 2015. This years game is called Recycle Rush if you would care to make a inquery on how it works before you take a gandor into the code. On our robot this year we also have 4 of our newest designed swerve modules that were fresh cut with the CNC the other day. The code for the swerve modules was mostly integrated over by way of last years robot that used a similar designed module. The robot has 3 major subsystems and everything else is just a part of the overall design that we can easily integrate. We work with eclipse so the package will be formatted in that way but if you hope to use it with netbeans or any other IDE you should have no problem finding the files withing the eclipse workspace i uploaded. I wish you all good luck this season and if you have any questions please email me at:
